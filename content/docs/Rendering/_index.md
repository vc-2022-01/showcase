# Introduction
One of the problems facing computer graphics is how to represent a 3D shape or model on a 2D monitor or screen. This is relevant, because the monitors on which the images are displayed are not continuous spaces like the real world, they are, instead, represented by a grid of pixels, which are a discrete units that can only take one color value. 

The computer then saves the model of the representation of the scene, which will be displayed on the screen, this process is called **rendering**, and is a process carried out in animation, video games, 3D modeling, among others.

In this paper we will present how the rendering process, known as the *graphic pipeline* allows a forced perspective of which the game **Superliminal** is based.

# Rendering
When rendering a scene, the main objective is to choose a *model* or *object* which will be rendered (it will have its own position, orientation and zoom) and a *screen* represented in two dimensions, to which the objecy will be translated. The rendering is done by changing different coordinate spaces. These coordinate spaces are:

## Model Space

This is the *x*,*y*,*z* coordinate space under which the object geometry is defined, usually the object is defined by primitives in this space.

## World Space

The world is the space under which the whole scene is defined, it has its origin in the center of the scene. It is possible to go from the model space to the world space by means of a model transformation.

## Eye Space or Camera

It is the coordinated space with origin in the center of the projection. The camera is the point of view from which the world is seen, it forms a *frustum* formed from four rays. Every object falling within the spectrum of the four rays will be perceived by the camera, as points in the world are reflected as rays back to the camera.

### Zoom

One of the characteristics of the eye space is the zoom. This originates from the fact that the frustum forms angles with the *x* and *y* coordinate axes. The larger these angles are, the more of the world space will be percieved in the projection and vice versa.

The zoom would allow the camera to increase the space it perceives by increasing its angles, as long as these maintain the proportionality of the image.

##  Screen Space

The screen space is a projection from the camera to a 2D space. This is used to project the camera space to a representation on monitors as it is known today on computers.

# Graphic Pipieline

This is a process that describes the steps of rendering an object to its 2D form or, rather, from object space to screen space.

# Superliminal

Superliminal is a video game from the first person perspective. The plot of the game consists of a player who finds himself trapped in a surreal place called the *dream space* and must find ways to escape from that place. However, a feature of the dream space mentioned above is that the player can change the size of objects using **forced perspective**.

##  Forced perspective

Forced perspective is a phenomenon in which the observer is deceived about the size of an object, i.e. it may appear larger or smaller than it actually is. This occurs because the representation of the scene in the human eye, in this case the camera, perceives the object in a way that appears different from reality.

In the specific case of the game, the player has control of the forced perspective, in that he can increase and decrease the size of the objects in the world without changing the size under the perspective of the camera. This is achieved because before the screen space that is generated by the rendering process, the created scene does not change even though in the world the object is changing.
