## The world and the pixel

Each pixel on the screen represents a quantity of space in the space of the world. The illusion of forced perspective allows to keep the relation that exists between the world and the pixel, that is to say, the amount of world that can be represented in the pixel in the space of the screen, this relation is going to be called *density* and is used by the function pixelRatio in the code previously seen.

### Move objects away

When the object is moved away from the screen on which it is being displayed, because of the angle of the frustum, the object reduces its size on the screen, however, in the world it still retains its size. This means that each pixel will contain more information about the world, even when the object is the same.

The following figure shows a map being represented in a grid which represent the pixels on a screen 
- Move the slider above to move the map further or closer to the screen
- Move the slider below to rotate our perception on the world (Hint: the map and the grid will rotate as well){{< /hint >}}

### Change Object's Size

What would happen now if we changed the wor object's size. The answer is that, in the same way that happened in when we changed the distance, the object would appear bigger or smaller on the screen.

The following figure shows a map being represented in a grid which represent the pixels on a screen 
- Move the slider above to move the map further or closer to the screen
- Move the slider in the middle to change the map's size
- Move the slider below to rotate our perception on the world (Hint: the map and the grid will rotate as well){{< /hint >}}

What would happen then if we increase the size while the scene is zoomed out? If we increase the size of the object at the same rate at which the field of view angle increases, what would happen is that the scene generated on the screen would not change, even though the size of the object does change. 

What does change is the pixel density, because even though the object is larger in the world, it is the same size on the screen, i.e., in this case the amount stored in each pixel of the world increases.
